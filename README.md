# Development Installation
In order to run in development mode, I used  a conda environment with python 3.10. Create one and activate it. 
```
conda create -n game python=3.10
conda activate game
```

Then, install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, simply run the main script.

```
cd Game
python main.py
```
